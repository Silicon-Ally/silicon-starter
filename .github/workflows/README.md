# Github Actions

If you use Github to deploy your code, you'll be pleased to find that
you'll have Continuous Integration (CI) out of the box. By default, every
commit pushed to Github for your repo will be built and tested, and you'll
be able to see the results of these runs in the "Action" tab of your repo's
Github page.

You can disable this feature by deleting these files, or renaming the folder
to something other than `.github/workflows`.
